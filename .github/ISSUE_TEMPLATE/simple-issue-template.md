Thanks for contributing to the improvement of `sysv_ipc`!

Most bug reports I get are actually problems with the system where `sysv_ipc` is being installed or built. (For example -- [compiler not installed](https://github.com/osvenskan/sysv_ipc/issues/21), [unsupported Python](https://github.com/osvenskan/sysv_ipc/issues/14), [system configuration issue](https://github.com/osvenskan/sysv_ipc/issues/16), [portability problem](https://github.com/osvenskan/sysv_ipc/issues/19),
etc.) Issues like these are best handled on the mailing list (https://groups.io/g/python-sysv-ipc/) where others can benefit from your experience (and maybe even help you figure out what's happening).

If you ask about something on the mailing list and it turns out to be a bug, you can still create an issue in the bug tracker. The mailing list is the first line of support.

If you still want to file a bug here, include basic platform info (Linux, Mac, etc.) and maybe the output from `uname -a`. Thanks!
