        I test all of the time-related variables in the IPC structs (o_time, shm_atime, shm_dtime,
        shm_ctime, msg_ctime, msg_stime, and msg_rtime) to ensure they change when they're supposed
        to (e.g. when a segment is detached, for shm_dtime). For variables that are initialized to 0
        (like o_time), it's easy to verify that they're 0 to start with and then non-zero after the
        change.

        Other variables (like shm_ctime) are trickier to test because they're already non-zero
        immediately after the object is created. My test has to save the value, do something that
        should change it, and then compare the saved value to the current one via assertNotEqual().

        Some (most? all?) systems define those time-related values as integral values (int or long),
        so their granularity is only 1 second. If I don't force at least 1 second to elapse between
        the statement where I save the value and the statement that should change it, they'll almost
        always happen in the same second and the assertNotEqual() even though all code (mine and the
        system) has behaved correctly.

        This method sleeps for 1.1 seconds to avoid the problem described above.
