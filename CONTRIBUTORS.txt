I wrote the original code in 2008 and have been the maintainer ever since
(Philip Semanchuk, https://github.com/osvenskan).

Several people have contributed code to this project. In addition, others
have contributed detailed problem reports, suggestions, troubleshooting, and
documentation updates.

Below is an incomplete list of contributors, in no particular order. I'm
grateful for all of the help. Some of them contributed indirectly by
contributing to this project's sister posix_ipc
(https://github.com/osvenskan/posix_ipc) which I also maintain. Many
improvements to posix_ipc are also relevant here.
