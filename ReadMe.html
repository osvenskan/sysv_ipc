<h2>System V IPC for Python - Semaphores and Shared Memory</h2>

<p>This describes the <tt>sysv_ipc</tt> module which gives Python access
to System V inter-process semaphores and shared memory on systems that support them.
That includes most (all?) *nix flavors but not Windows. At present, IPC
message queues are not supported.
</p>

<p>If you're interested in this module, there are 
<a href="http://semanchuk.com/philip/PythonIpc/">other low-level IPC extensions
for Python</a> that you might find useful. 
</p>


<p>You can <strong>download 
<a href="sysv_ipc-0.2.1.tar.gz">sysv_ipc version 0.2.1</a>
</strong>
<a href="sysv_ipc-0.2.1.md5.txt">[md5 sum]</a>

which contains the source code, setup.py, installation instructions and
<a href="#samples">sample code</a>. You might also want to read
about some <a href="#bugs">known bugs</a>. Currently, this module
only works with Python 2.5. If you need to access SysV IPC objects with
older versions of Python, have a look at 
<a href="http://nikitathespider.com/python/shm/">the shm module</a>.
I've tested <tt>sysv_ipc</tt> on 
OS X 10.5 and Ubuntu 8. It doesn't compile on OpenSolaris 2008.05.
</p>

<p class="dangerdanger">Please note: This module is new and has not been
rigorously tested.
</p>


<h2>Module <tt>sysv_ipc</tt></h2>

<h3>Module Functions</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>remove_semaphore(id)</dt>
    <dd>Removes the semaphore with the given <tt>id</tt>.</dd>
        
    <dt>remove_shared_memory(id)</dt>
    <dd>Removes the shared memory with the given <tt>id</tt>.</dd>
</dl>
        

<h3>Module Constants</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>IPC_CREAT, IPC_EXCL and IPC_CREX</dt>
    <dd><tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> and <tt>IPC_EXCL</tt> are flags used when 
        creating IPC objects. They're
        bitwise unique and can be ORed together. <tt>IPC_CREX</tt> is 
        shorthand for <tt>IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL</tt>.
        
        <p>When passed to an IPC object's constructor, <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> indicates 
            that you want to create a new object or open an existing one. If you want
            the call to fail if an object with that key already exists, specify 
            the  <tt>IPC_EXCL</tt> flag, too.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>IPC_PRIVATE</dt>
    <dd>This is a special value that can be passed in place of a key. It implies that 
        the IPC object should be available only to the creating process or its
        child processes (e.g. those created with <tt>fork()</tt>).
    </dd>
    
    <dt>KEY_MAX</dt>
    <dd>Keys passed to IPC object constructors must not exceed KEY_MAX.
    </dd>

    <dt>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</dt>
    <dd>The maximum value of a semaphore.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>PAGE_SIZE</dt>
    <dd>The operating system's memory page size, in bytes. It's probably a good
        idea to make shared memory segments some multiple of this size.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</dt>
    <dd>True if the platform supports timed semaphore waits, False otherwise.</dd>

    <dt>SHM_RND</dt>
    <dd>You probably don't need this, but it can be used when attaching shared 
        memory to force the address to be
        rounded down to SHMLBA. See your system's man page for <tt>shmat()</tt>
        for more information.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SHM_HUGETLB, SHM_NORESERVE and SHM_REMAP</dt>
    <dd>You probably don't need these. They're Linux-specific flags that can 
        be passed to the SysVSharedMemory
        constructor, or to the <tt>.attach()</tt> function in the case of 
        SHM_REMAP. See your system's man page for <tt>shmget()</tt>
        and <tt>shmat()</tt> for more information.
    </dd>
</dl>    

<h3>Module Errors</h3>

<p>In addition to standard Python errors (e.g. <tt>ValueError</tt>),
this module raises custom errors. These errors cover 
situations specific to IPC.
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>SysVIpcError</dt>
    <dd>The base error class for all the custom errors in this module. This
        error is occasionally raised on its own but you'll almost 
        always see a more specific error.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SysVIpcInternalError</dt>
    <dd>Indicates that something has gone very wrong in the module code. Please
        report this to the maintainer.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SysVIpcPermissionsError</dt>
    <dd>Indicates that you've attempted something that the permissions on the
        IPC object don't allow.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SysVIpcExistentialError</dt>
    <dd>Indicates an error related to the existence or non-existence of 
        an IPC object. 
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SysVIpcBusyError</dt>
    <dd>Raised when a semaphore call to <tt>.P()</tt> or <tt>.Z()</tt> either times out 
        or would be forced to wait when its <tt>block</tt> attribute is False.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>SysVIpcNotAttachedError</dt>
    <dd>Raised when a process attempts to read from or write to a shared memory
        segment to which it is not attached.
    </dd>
</dl>


<h3>The SysVSemaphore Class</h3>

<p>This is a handle to a semaphore.</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>SysVSemaphore(key, [flags = 0, [mode = 0600, [initial_value = 0]]])</dt>
    <dd>Creates a new semaphore or opens an existing one.
        
        <p><span class="param">key</span> must be either the value IPC_PRIVATE or 
        an integer &gt; 0 and &le; KEY_MAX.
        </p>
        
        <p>The <span class="param">flags</span> specify whether you want to create a
            new semaphore or open an existing one.
        </p> 
            
        <ul>
            <li>With <span class="param">flags</span> set to the default of <tt>0</tt>, the module attempts
                to open an existing semaphore identified by <span class="param">key</span> and raises 
                a <tt>SysVIpcExistentialError</tt> if that semaphore doesn't exist.
            </li>
            
            <li>With <span class="param">flags</span> set to <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt>, the module 
                opens the semaphore identified by <span class="param">key</span> or creates a new
                one if no such semaphore exists. Using <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> by itself
                is not recommended. (See <a href="#sem_init">Semaphore Initialization</a>.)
            </li>
            
            <li>With <span class="param">flags</span> set to 
                <tt>IPC_CREX</tt> (<tt>IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL</tt>),
                the module 
                creates a new semaphore identified by <span class="param">key</span>. If a 
                semaphore with that key already exists, the call raises a
                <tt>SysVIpcExistentialError</tt>. 
                <strong>The <span class="param">initial_value</span> is ignored unless
                    both of these flags are specified</strong> or 
                    if the semaphore is read-only.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>When opening an existing semaphore, <span class="param">mode</span> is ignored.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>acquire([timeout = None, [delta = 1]])</dt>
    <dd>Waits (conditionally) until the semaphore's value is &gt; 0 and then returns, 
        decrementing the semaphore. 
        
        <p>The <span class="param">timeout</span> (which can be a float) specifies how
            many seconds this call should wait, if at all.
        </p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>A <span class="param">timeout</span> of None (the default)
                implies no time limit. The call will not return until its wait 
                condition is satisfied. 

                <p>This behavior can be overriden by the semaphore object's 
                    <tt>.block</tt> flag. When that flag is True (the default), the
                    call waits. When that flag is False, the call 
                    raises a <tt>SysVIpcBusyError</tt> if it can't immediately
                    acquire the semaphore.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>When <span class="param">timeout</span> is 0, the call 
                raises a <tt>SysVIpcBusyError</tt> if it can't immediately
                acquire the semaphore. Since it will 
                return immediately if <em>not</em> asked to wait, this can be 
                thought of as "non-blocking" mode.
            </li>
            
            <li>When the <span class="param">timeout</span> is &gt; 0, the call
                will wait no longer than <span class="param">timeout</span> 
                seconds before either returning (having acquired the semaphore)
                or raising a <tt>SysVIpcBusyError</tt>.

                <p>On platforms that don't support the <tt>semtimedop()</tt> API
                  (OS X doesn't support it), 
                   a <span class="param">timeout</span> &gt; 0 is treated as 
                   a timeout of infinity; i.e. 
                   the call should wait indefinitely regardless of the
                   value of the semaphore's <tt>.block</tt> flag.
                </p>
                
                <p>The module's Boolean constant <tt>SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT_SUPPORTED</tt>
                    is True on platforms that support <tt>semtimedop()</tt>.
                </p>
            </li>        
        </ul>

        <p>When the call returns, the semaphore's value decreases by <span class="param">delta</span> 
            (or more precisely,  <tt>abs(<span class="param">delta</span>)</tt>)
            which defaults to 1.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    
    <dt>release([delta = 1])</dt>
    <dd>
        Releases (increments) the semaphore.
        
        <p>The semaphore's value increases by <span class="param">delta</span> 
            (or more precisely, <tt>abs(<span class="param">delta</span>)</tt>)
            which defaults to 1. 
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>P()</dt>
    <dd>A synonym for <tt>.acquire()</tt> that takes the same parameters.
        
        <p>"P" stands for 
        <span lang="nl">prolaag</span> or <span lang="nl">probeer te verlagen</span>
        (try to decrease), the original name given by 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">Edsger Dijkstra</a>.
        </p>
    </dd>    
    
    <dt>V()</dt>
    <dd>A synonym for <tt>.release()</tt> that takes the same parameters.

        <p>"V" stands for 
        <span lang="nl">verhoog</span> (increase), the original name given by 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">Edsger Dijkstra</a>.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Z([timeout = None])</dt>
    <dd>Blocks until zee zemaphore is zero.
        
        <p><span class="param">Timeout</span> has
            the same meaning as described in <tt>.acquire()</tt>.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>remove()</dt>
    <dd>
        Removes (deletes) the semaphore from the system. 
        
        <p>As far as I can tell, the effect of deleting a semaphore that
            other processes are still using is OS-dependent. Check your system's
            man pages for <tt>semctl(IPC_RMID)</tt>. 
        </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>key (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The key passed in the call to the constructor.</dd>
    
    <dt>id (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The id assigned to this semaphore by the OS.</dd>
    
    <dt>value</dt>
    <dd>The integer value of the semaphore.</dd>
    
    <dt>undo</dt>
    <dd>
        Defaults to False.
        
        <p>When True, operations that change the
        semaphore's value will be undone (reversed) when 
        the process exits. Note that when a process exits, an undo operation
        may imply that a semaphore's value should become negative or 
        exceed its maximum.
        Behavior in this case is system-dependent, which means that 
        <strong>using this flag can make your code non-portable</strong>.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>block</dt>
    <dd>
        Defaults to True, which means that calls to <tt>P()</tt> and 
        <tt>Z()</tt> that specify a <span class="param">timeout</span>
        of None will not return
        until their wait conditions are satisfied. 
        
        <p>When False, these calls
        will not block but will instead raise an error if they are unable
        to return immediately.
        </p>
        
        
    </dd>
    
    <dt>mode</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore's permission bits.
        
        <p>Tip: the following Python code will display
        the mode in octal:<br>
        <tt>print int(str(mysem.mode), 8)</tt>
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>uid</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore's user id.</dd>
    
    <dt>gid</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore's group id.</dd>
    
    <dt>cuid (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore creator's user id.</dd>
    
    <dt>cgid (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The semaphore creator's group id.</dd>
    
    <dt>last_pid (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The PID of the process that last called <tt>semop()</tt> (<tt>.P()</tt>, 
        <tt>.V()</tt> or <tt>.Z()</tt>) on this semaphore.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>waiting_for_nonzero (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The number of processes waiting for the value of the semaphore to become
        non-zero (i.e. the number waiting in a call to <tt>.P()</tt>).
    </dd>
    
    <dt>waiting_for_zero (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The number of processes waiting for the value of the semaphore to become 
        zero (i.e. the number waiting in a call to <tt>.Z()</tt>).
    </dd>

    <dt>o_time (read-only)</dt>
    <dd>The last time <tt>semop()</tt> (i.e. <tt>.P()</tt>, <tt>.V()</tt> or
        <tt>.Z()</tt>) was called on this semaphore.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>The SysVSharedMemory Class</h3>

<p>This is a handle to a shared memory segment. 
</p>


<h4>Methods</h4>

<dl>
    <dt>SysVSharedMemory(key, [flags = 0, [mode = 0600, [size = 0 or PAGE_SIZE, [init_character = ' ']]]])</dt>
    <dd>Creates a new shared memory segment or opens an existing one. 
        The memory is automatically attached.
        
        <p>The 
        <span class="param">key</span> must be either the value IPC_PRIVATE or 
        an integer &gt; 0 and &le; KEY_MAX. 
        </p>

        <p>The <span class="param">flags</span> specify whether you want to create a

        </p> 
            
        <ul>
            <li>With <span class="param">flags</span> set to the 
                <strong>default</strong> of <tt>0</tt>, the module attempts
                to <strong>open an existing</strong> shared memory segment identified by 
                <span class="param">key</span> and raises 
                a <tt>SysVIpcExistentialError</tt> if it doesn't exist.
            </li>
            
            <li>With <span class="param">flags</span> set to <strong><tt>IPC_CREAT</tt></strong>, the module 
                <strong>opens</strong> the shared memory segment identified 
                by <span class="param">key</span> <strong>or 
                creates</strong> a new one if no such segment exists.
                Using <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> by itself
                is not recommended. (See <a href="#mem_init">Memory Initialization</a>.)

                <strong>creates</strong> a new shared memory segment identified by 
                <span class="param">key</span>. If 
                a segment with that key already exists, the call raises 
                a <tt>SysVIpcExistentialError</tt>.
        
                <p>When both <tt>IPC_CREX</tt> is specified
                    and the caller has write permission, each byte in the new memory segment will be 
                    initialized to the value of <span class="param">init_character</span>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The value of <span class="param">size</span> depends on whether

        <ul>
            <li>When opening an existing segment, <span class="param">size</span>

            </li>
            
            <li>When creating an new segment, 
                many (most? all?) operating systems insist on a <span class="param">size</span>
                &gt; <tt>0</tt>.
                In addition, some round the size
                up to the next multiple of PAGE_SIZE.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This module supplies a default 
            <span class="param">size</span> of <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt> when 
            <tt>IPC_CREX</tt> is specified and <tt>0</tt> otherwise. 
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>attach([address = None, [flags = 0]])</dt>
    <dd>
        Attaches this process to the shared memory. The memory must be attached 
        before calling <tt>.read()</tt> or <tt>.write()</tt>. Note that the
        constructor automatically attaches the memory
        so you won't need to call this method unless you explicitly detach it 
        and then want to use it again.
        
        <p>The address parameter allows one to specify (as a Python long) a memory
            address at which to attach the segment. Passing None (the default)
            is equivalent to passing NULL to <tt>shmat()</tt>. See that
            function's man page for details.
        </p>
        
        <p>The flags are mostly only relevant if one specifies a specific address.
            One exception is the flag <tt>SHM_RDONLY</tt> which, surprisingly,
            attaches the segment read-only.
        </p>
        
        <p>Note that on some (and perhaps all) platforms, each call to <tt>.attach()</tt>
            increments the system's "attached" count. Thus, if each call to 
            <tt>.attach()</tt> isn't paired with a call to <tt>.detach()</tt>,
            the system's "attached" count for the shared memory segment will not
            go to zero when the process exits. As a result, the shared memory
            segment may not disappear even when its creator calls <tt>.remove()</tt>
            and exits.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>detach()</dt>
    <dd>Detaches this process from the shared memory.</dd>
    
    <dt>read([byte_count = 0, [offset = 0]])</dt>
    <dd>Reads up to <span class="param">byte_count</span> bytes from the 
        shared memory segment starting at <span class="param">offset</span>
        and returns them as a Python string. 
        
        <p>If <span class="param">byte_count</span> is zero (the default) the entire 
            buffer is returned.
        </p>
        
        <p>This method will never attempt to read past the end of the shared 
            memory segment, even when 
            <span class="param">offset</span> + <span class="param">byte_count</span> 
            exceeds the memory segment's size. In that case, the bytes
            from <span class="param">offset</span> to the end of the segment are returned.
        </p>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>write(s, [offset = 0])</dt>
    <dd>Writes the string <span class="param">s</span> to the shared memory,
        starting at <span class="param">offset</span>. 
        
        <p>At most <tt><i>n</i></tt> bytes will be written, where 
            <tt><i>n</i></tt> = the segment's size minus <span class="param">offset</span>.
        </p>
        
        <p>The string may contain embedded NULL bytes ('\0').
    </dd>
    
    <dt>remove()</dt>
    <dd>Removes (destroys) the shared memory. Note that actual destruction of the
        segment only occurs when all processes have detached.
    </dd>

<h3>Supported Features and Differences from SHM</h3>

<p>This module is almost, but not quite, a superset of 
<a href="http://nikitathespider.com/python/shm/"><tt>shm</tt></a>.
Some of the additional features are the ability to override the <tt>block</tt>
flag on a per-call basis, the ability to change the semaphore's value
in increments &gt; 1 when calling <tt>.P()</tt> and <tt>.V()</tt>
and exposure of <tt>sem_otime</tt>.
</p>

<p>Differences that might trip you up are listed below.</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>Shm</tt> compiles on more platforms and under more versions of Python.</li>
    <li>Attribute names and method signatures are different.</li>
    <li>This module offers neither the functions <tt>semaphore_haskey()</tt>
        nor <tt>memory_haskey()</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>This module doesn't offer access to <tt>ftok()</tt> which is
        for the best because 
        <a href="http://nikitathespider.com/python/shm/#ftok">ftok is
        probably broken on your system</a>.
    </li>
    <li>This module's default permission on objects is <tt>0600</tt> as opposed
        to <tt>shm</tt>'s <tt>0666</tt>.
    </li>
    <li><tt>Shm</tt> maintained an internal dictionary of semaphores and shared memory
        segments. The object keys served as the dictionary keys.
        If you asked for the same object multiple times, <tt>shm</tt> would
        return the same Python object. I'm not convinced this was safe,
        particularly in the case where an object may have been destroyed 
        and another with the same key created in its place.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage Tips</h3>

<h4 id="sem_init">Semaphore Initialization</h4>

<p>When a System V sempahore is created at the C API level, the OS is not required
to initialize the semaphore's value. (This per 
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/semget.html">the 
POSIX standard for <tt>semget()</tt></a>.) 
Some (most?) operating systems initialize it to zero, but this behavior
is non-standard and therefore can't be relied upon. 
</p>

<p>If sempahore creation happens in an predictable, orderly fashion, this isn't a 
problem. But a
race condition arises when multiple processes vie to create/open the same semaphore. The 
problem lies in the fact that when an application calls <tt>semget()</tt> with only
the <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> flag, the caller can't tell whether or not he has
created a new semaphore or opened an existing one. 
<strong>This makes it
difficult to create reliable code without using <tt>IPC_EXCL</tt>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
For instance, imagine processes P1 and P2. They're executing the same code, 
and that code intends to share a binary semaphore.
Consider the following sequence of events at the startup of P1 and P2 &ndash;
</p>

<ol>
    <li>P1 calls <tt>semget(IPC_CREAT)</tt> to create the semaphore S.</li>
    <li>P2 calls <tt>semget(IPC_CREAT)</tt> to open S.</li>
    <li>P1 initializes the semaphore's value to 1.</li>
    <li>P1 calls <tt>acquire()</tt>, decrementing the value to 0.</li>
    <li>P2, assuming S is a newly-created semaphore that needs to be initialized,
        incorrectly sets the semaphore's value to 1.</li>
    <li>P2 calls <tt>acquire()</tt>, decrementing the value to 0. Both processes
        now think they own the lock.</li>
</ol>

<p>The canonical solution for this race condition is to check the value of 
<tt>sem_otime</tt> (an element in the <tt>semid_ds</tt> struct that's 
populated on call to <tt>semctl(IPC_STAT)</tt> and which is exposed to 
Python by this module) which
is initialized to zero when the semaphore is created and otherwise holds 
the time of the last 
call to <tt>semop()</tt>. 
</p>

<p>In Python, each process would run something like this:
<pre>
try:
   sem = sysv_ipc.SysVSemaphore(42, sysv_ipc.CREX)
except sysv_ipc.SysVIpcExistentialError:
   # One of my peers created the semaphore already
   sem = sysv_ipc.SysVSemaphore(42)
   
while not sem.o_time:
    time.sleep(.1)
    
# Now the semaphore is safe to use.
</pre>


<h4 id="mem_init">Shared Memory Initialization</h4>

<p>With shared memory, 
using the <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> flag without <tt>IPC_EXCL</tt>
is problematic <em>unless you know the size of the segment 
you're potentially opening</em>.
</p>

<p>Why? Because when creating a new segment, 
many (most? all?) operating systems demand a non-zero size. However,
when opening an existing segment, zero is the only guaranteed safe value
(again, assuming one doesn't know the size of the segment in advance). 
Since <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt>
can open or create a segment, there's no safe value for the size under
this circumstance.
</p>

<p>As a (sort of) side note, the 
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/shmget.html">POSIX
specification for <tt>shmget()</tt></a> says only that the size of a new 
segment must not be less than "the system-imposed minimum". I 
gather that at one time, some systems set the minimum at zero despite the 
fact that it doesn't make much sense to create a zero-length shared memory
segment. I think most modern systems do the sensible thing and insist on
a minimum length of 1.
</p>

<h4>Nobody Likes a Mr. Messy</h4>

<p>Semaphores and especially shared memory are a little different from most Python objects 
and therefore require a little more care on the part of the programmer. When a 
program creates a semaphore or shared memory object, it creates something that 
resides <em>outside of its own process</em>, just like a file on a hard drive. It 
won't go away when your process ends unless you explicitly remove it.
</p>

<p>In short, remember to clean up after yourself.</p>

<h4>Consult Your Local <tt>man</tt> Pages</h4>

<p>The sysv_ipc module is just a wrapper around your system's API. If your 
system's implementation has quirks, the <tt>man</tt> pages for <tt>semget, semctl, semop
shmget, shmat, shmdt</tt> and <tt>shmctl</tt> will probably cover them.
</p>

<h4>Interesting Tools</h4>

<p>Many systems (although not some older versions of OS X) come 
with <tt>ipcs</tt> and <tt>ipcrm</tt>.
The former shows existing shared memory, semaphores and message queues on your system and
the latter allows you to remove them.
</p>

<h3 id="bugs">Known Bugs</h3>

<p>Bugs? My code never has bugs! There are, however, some suboptimal anomalies...</p>

<ul>
    <li>Compilation on OS X and perhaps elsewhere produces 3 warnings from 
        <tt>pyport.h</tt>. They're caused by
        the <tt>#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600</tt> line at the top of the .c module.
    </li>        
    <li>Maximum values for uids, gids, keys and semaphore values are 
        hardcoded to "safe" values rather than being platform dependent.
        It turns out 
        that <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c/browse_thread/thread/14a1cdbfb111f4eb">it's
        really difficult to determine the maximum value that a 
        typedef-ed variable can hold</a>.

</ul>

<h3>Version History</h3>

<ul id="history">
    <li><strong>Current &ndash; 0.2.1 (3 Jan 2009) &ndash;</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug that prevented the module-specific
                errors (<tt>SysVIpcExistentialError</tt>, etc.) from
                being visible in the module.
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that re-initialized shared memory with 
                the init character when only <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> was specified
                and an existing segment was opened.
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that always defaulted the size of a shared 
                memory segment to <tt>PAGE_SIZE</tt>. Updated code and 
                documentation to use intelligent defaults. <em>Tack</em> to 
                Jesper for the bug report.
            </li>
            <li>Several cosmetic changes. (Added more metadata to setup.py,
                added a newline to the end of probe_results.h to avoid
                compiler complaints, etc.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>0.2 (16 Dec 2008) &ndash;
        Lots of small fixes.
        
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug where calling <tt>shm.remove()</tt> on shared 
               memory that was already removed would cause a SystemError. 
               (I wasn't setting the Python error before returning.)
            </li>
               
            <li>Fixed a couple of bugs that would cause the creation
                of a new, read-only shared memory segment to fail.
            </li>
            
            <li>Fixed a bug that would cause the creation
                of a new, read-only semaphore to fail.
            </li>
            
            <li>Added the constant <tt>IPC_CREX</tt>.</li>

            <li>Renamed (sorry) <tt>MAX_KEY</tt> to <tt>KEY_MAX</tt> and
                <tt>MAX_SEMAPHORE_VALUE</tt> to <tt>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</tt>
                to be consistent with the C naming convention in limits.h.
            </li>

            <li>Hardcoded <tt>SEMAPHORE_VALUE_MAX</tt> to 32767 until I can 
                find a reliable way to determine it at install time.
            </li>

            <li>Changed prober.py to write out a C header file with 
                platform-specific definitions in it.
            </li>

            <li>Replaced OSError in shared memory functions with more
                specific <tt>SysVIpc</tt> errors.
            </li>

            <li>Added code to raise a ValueError when an attempt is made
                to assign an out-of-range value to a semaphore.
            </li>

            <li>Added code to raise a ValueError when an out-of-range key 
                is passed to a constructor.
            </li>

            <li>Fixed a bug in the demo program conclusion.c that caused
                some informational messages to be printed twice.
            </li>

            <li>Fixed some documentation bugs.</li>
        </ul>
