sysv_ipc - Python access to System V shared memory and semaphores
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sysv_ipc is a Python module that gives access to System V shared memory and semaphores on *nix systems. Windows users, you're out of luck here; these modules only work on platforms that support System V shared objects. Most *nixes do (including OS X) but Windows does not.

The latest version, contact info, etc. are available here:
http://semanchuk.com/philip/sysv_ipc/

Installation is as simple as `sudo python setup.py install`. Usage, a version history, warnings, suggestions, etc. are covered in ReadMe.html.

sysv_ipc is free software (free as in freedom and free as in beer). Licensing information is available in the LICENSE file.

Enjoy,
