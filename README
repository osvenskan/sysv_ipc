sysv_ipc - Python access to System V IPC objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sysv_ipc gives access to System V semaphores, shared memory and message 
queues. Most (all?) Unixes (including OS X) support System V IPC. 
Windows+Cygwin 1.7 might also work. 

Sample code is included.

Usage, a version history, warnings, suggestions, etc. are covered in 
ReadMe.html.

sysv_ipc is free software (free as in freedom and free as in beer). Licensing
information is available in the LICENSE file.

Enjoy,
